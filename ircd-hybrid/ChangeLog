2006-06-13 03:38:50  michael

	* [r673] src/s_conf.c:
	  - check_classes(): Only call destroy_cidr_class() on a class that is ready
	    for deletion, otherwise the current cidr count would become unadjusted in
	    case a disabled class gets re-enabled later on.

2006-06-13 03:28:30  michael

	* [r672] src/s_conf.c:

	  src/s_conf.c, src/y.tab.c:
	  - Fixed class limit bug as spotted by stu.  ("REHASH" would always reset
	    current user count)
	  - Made "STATS y|Y" show inactive (deleted) classes that still have attached
	    clients

2006-06-12 08:20:55  michael

	* [r670] RELNOTES, include/balloc.h, src/balloc.c:

2006-06-11 09:39:25  michael

	* [r668] lib/pcre/README, src/y.tab.c, src/y.tab.h:
	  - Rebuilt y.tab.(c|h) using bison 2.3
	  - Bumped pcrelib version to 6.4.  There were no changes since 6.3 that would
	    have affected our hacked version of the pcre library, so this is mainly to
	    satisfy paranoid I-always-need-the-latest-version people

2006-06-10 19:35:38  stu

	* [r666] modules/core/m_message.c:

2006-06-08 03:00:17  michael

	* [r650] include/client.h, src/client.c, src/s_auth.c:
	  - Fixed bug that would exit unknown clients in check_unknowns_list() that are
	    still processing auth/dns queries.
	    Basically check_unknowns_list() should only exit clients that have finished
	    auth/dns and didn't send a NICK/USER combination since they have been
	    released from auth.
	  
	    Reported by ThaPrince.

2006-06-07 08:42:00  michael

2006-06-01 08:30:29  db

	* [r633] include/irc_string.h, src/channel.c, src/match.c:
	  - optimise Michael's fake channel catcher.
	    Make it work first, then optimise.

	  - Rebuilt y.tab.c using bison 2.2

2006-05-23 03:07:53  michael

	* [r618] include/s_conf.h, src/s_conf.c:

	    attached to a server or operator.  Spotted by stu.
	  - Removed IRCD_SOCKET_ERROR define

2006-05-22 03:21:17  michael

	* [r617] src/client.c:
	  - report_error() expects two %s conversion specifiers as reported by ThaPrince.
	    This function really should get rewritten at given time.  It just confuses
	    people.

2006-05-22 03:10:56  michael

	* [r616] contrib/m_clearchan.c:
	  - Backported m_clearchan:kick_list fixes

2006-05-12 17:17:16  michael

	* [r595] src/ircd_parser.y, src/y.tab.c:
	  - Backported core fix for regexp k-lines

2006-05-12 16:05:57  michael

	* [r594] src/ircd_signal.c:
	  - Ignore signal SIGXFSZ which killed the ircd process on daxnet because of
	    a file size limit set too low.  That way, write() and friends will abort
	    and errno will be set to EFBIG.  We may think about a NOTICE which could
	    be sent to operators on a failed write attempt to either the log files
	    or k/x-line files.

	  src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c, src/y.tab.c, src/y.tab.h:
	  - Backported RKLINE fix so the user and host portion of a banmask don't get
	    cut off after 10 and 63 chars, respectively.
	    A split_nuh() rewrite was required for this.
	  - Removed now unused xstrldup() function

2006-05-11 08:43:02  michael

	* [r592] src/s_user.c:
	  - Merged check_xline() and check_regexp_xline into a single function

2006-05-08 14:40:00  michael

	* [r589] modules/m_admin.c, modules/m_motd.c, src/s_user.c:
	  - Clear the TS6 CAPAB bit possibly set on an unregistered client connection
	    in mr_motd(), mr_admin() and register_local_user(). This is a kludge for now.

2006-05-08 09:22:59  michael

	* [r588] modules/m_restart.c, src/restart.c:
	  - m_restart(): don't send restart notices twice to locally connected clients

	  - Added new general::stats_e_disabled configuration option.  Known from RB,
	    all it does is to disable "STATS e", which is a good idea if you have any
	    exempted server ips.
	  - Updated RELNOTES

	* [r583] etc/example.conf, etc/example.efnet.conf:

	* [r572] contrib/m_clearchan.c, include/channel.h, src/channel.c, 
	  src/channel_mode.c, src/send.c:

	    This is mainly to save about 5megs of ram on networks like efnet where

	* [r148] modules/m_testline.c:
	  - backport fix for memory leak and parv1 from HEAD

2005-10-16 06:07:13  michael

	* [r145] modules/m_whowas.c:
	  - Limit maximum WHOWAS replies for remote requests to 20, as per H6

2005-10-16 05:49:16  michael

	* [r143] modules/m_whowas.c:
	  - Fixed a bug where remoteservers would send us an ERROR
	    on "WHOWAS nick count remoteserver.net".  Propably one
	    of the oldest bugs that got introduced in 7.0.
	  
	    (Backported from HEAD)

2005-10-15 21:20:07  db

	* [r138] modules/m_testline.c:
	  - fix compile warning

2005-10-15 19:39:54  db

	* [r136] modules/m_testline.c, src/ircd_parser.y, src/y.tab.c, 
	  src/y.tab.h:
	  - backport fixes from 7.3 (HEAD) for testline and ~ flags

2005-10-13 15:48:20  michael

	* [r124] etc/example.conf, etc/example.efnet.conf:
	  - Updated example.conf as suggested by pi

2005-10-11 11:10:35  michael

	* [r105] contrib/m_ctrace.c:
	  - Fixed compile error in m_ctrace.c

2005-10-10 14:29:05  adx

	* [r103] modules/m_links.c:
	  - MFC: fixed core on /links

2005-10-10 08:17:19  michael

	* [r102] src/ircd_parser.y, src/s_conf.c, src/y.tab.c, src/y.tab.h:
	  - That one should be the propper fix for GDENY items.  Previous fix broke
	    the ability of stacking user/name/action combinations.
	    That fix still needs to go into -HEAD, and VERY important, into 7.1.3.
	    Someone please test this, e.g. write a small dump function that spits out
	    GDENY items.

2005-10-09 10:43:13  michael

	* [r100] include/ircd_defs.h, modules/core/m_join.c, src/s_conf.c:
	  - CHANNELLEN vs. LOCAL_CHANNELLEN fix.  Local JOINs are limited to 50chars whereas
	    remote SJOINs/JOINs can be upto 200chars for backwards compatibility.

2005-10-08 12:27:32  db

	* [r96] src/y.tab.c, src/y.tab.h:
	  - And update the parser files

2005-10-08 12:26:37  db

	* [r95] src/ircd_parser.y:
	  - At the very least, don't create a gdeny conf with a NULL name,
	    this is bad manners.

2005-10-08 07:26:25  michael

	* [r94] RELNOTES:
	  - Updated 7.2 RELNOTES

2005-10-08 07:24:01  michael

	* [r93] modules/m_whois.c:
	  - Fixed bug in m_whois() that would allow users to send a WHOIS to remote
	    servers with an empty argument via "WHOIS someserver.org :"

2005-10-03 19:44:13  adx

	* [r66] help/opers/stats:
	  - added /stats h to help

2005-10-03 08:13:38  michael

	* [r58] src/s_conf.c:
	  - Reverted oper_privs_as_string() back to its previous version which is easier
	    to maintain when adding new operflags. Even the one who wrote the new version
	    introduced a bug by not taking care to keep the oper_flags_table in sync
	    with the OPER_FLAGS_* bits.  (which also no one really wants to do ...)
	  - Updated it to deal with new 'remoteban', 'operwall' and 'operspy' flags

2005-10-03 07:33:30  michael

	* [r56] RELNOTES, etc/example.conf, etc/example.efnet.conf, 
	  include/s_conf.h, src/ircd_lexer.l, src/ircd_parser.y, 
	  src/lex.yy.c, src/s_user.c, src/y.tab.c, src/y.tab.h:
	  - Re-added an equivalent of H6's sixth O-line field (Modes to get on operup).
	  - Updated efnet's example.conf to reflect the new
	    opers_bypass_callerid directive
	  - Misc style corrections to s_user.c while on it

2005-10-02 21:14:44  lusky

	* [r46] include/serno.h:
	  MFC: switch to static "SVN" string

2005-10-02 19:25:27  adx

	* [r42] src/s_serv.c:
	  - *hopefully* this hack fixes cryptlinks+ts6 instead of breaking them ;)

2005-10-02 18:39:02  adx

	* [r40] etc/example.conf, etc/example.efnet.conf:
	  - documented cidr_bitlen

2005-10-02 18:27:12  adx

	* [r38] src/ircd_parser.y, src/y.tab.c, src/y.tab.h:
	  - MFC disallow ':' at the beginning and ' ' in server passwords

2005-10-02 17:05:51  lusky

	* [r34] /ircd-hybrid-7.2:
	  create 7.2 branch, we can move/rename it as needed.
